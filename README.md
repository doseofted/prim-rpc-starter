In this project, we have a web server in Node and a website built with Vite:

- [`server/module.ts`](./server/index.ts) is where your functions are created
- [`server/index.ts`](./server/index.ts) is the Prim+RPC server, using the Fetch API
- [`client/prim.ts`](./client/prim.ts) is the Prim+RPC client, using the Fetch API
- [`client/index.ts`](./client/index.ts) is where your functions are called

You can start this project in development mode by running:

```zsh
npm install
npm run dev
```
